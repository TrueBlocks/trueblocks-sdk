## Introduction

This repo holds auto-generated SDKs based on [TrueBlocks Core](https://github.com/TrueBlocks/trueblocks-core). Use it to build amazing local-first applications such as [TrueBlocks Browse](https://github.com/TrueBlocks/trueblocks-browse) (currently private).

You are welcome to use the SDK, but it is currently pre-alpha.

## Documentation
