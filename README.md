## Introduction

The TrueBlocks SDK provides access to the TrueBlocks API server. This code is autogenerated from the [openApi.yaml](https://github.com/TrueBlocks/trueblocks-core/blob/master/docs/content/api/openapi.yaml) on our website.

## Disclaimer

This SDK is intended for use by the core developers of TrueBlocks as we develop our own applications, and is therefore purposefully not documented. This is so we **do not** create an unwanted support burden for our team. You are welcome to use the SDK, but we will do not provide technical support.

However, we do welcome issues and PR's (particularly documentation) from the community.

## Generating the SDK

To generate the SDK, call `yarn generate:sdk` from this folder.

## Directories and files

| Folder         | Description                                                             |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ./src          | source of the SDK generator (in Typescript)                             |
| ./dist         | target for SDK generator JavaScript files (so it can be used with Node) |
| ./generated_ts | generated SDK Typescript files                                          |
| ./out          | generated SDK JavaScript files (if enabled)                             |
| ./input        | modules that don't need to be generated and are just copied             |

## Notes

- Generating the SDK as JavaScript is possible, but currently disabled. To enable, remove "noEmit" from `generated_tsconfig.json`.
- You may, if you wish, create a file called `.env` in this local folder containing a single line: `ULR=<alternative_path_for_openapi.yaml>`. The SDK will be generated from that URL, if found. This may be helpful during development.
